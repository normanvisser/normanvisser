### Hi there, I am Norman

I'm from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I'm a neuropsychology graduate and after years of working in the social field I decided to turn things around by getting into coding. 

Recently I finished the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp by Codaisseur at Amsterdam. Here I've developed a great set of technical skills and I'm looking forward on elaborating on them!
